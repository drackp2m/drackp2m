## About me

I am a senior full-stack developer, currently working in Bit2me in the community of CastellÃ³n, Spain.

With more than eight years of experience, along the way I have liked several technologies and projects, among which stand out in recent years:
- [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
- [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular)
- [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)
- [MikroORM](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm)
- [Elf](https://github.com/ngneat/elf)
- [Nx](https://github.com/nrwl/nx)

Currently I continue to train and work hard to continue learning.
